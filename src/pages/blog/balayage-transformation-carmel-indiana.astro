    <h2>Why Balayage Is the Most Requested Service in Carmel</h2>
    <p>Balayage has become one of our most popular services at Glow Salon & Spa, and for good reason. Unlike traditional highlights that use foils, balayage is a freehand painting technique that creates softer, more natural-looking color transitions. The result is a sun-kissed look that grows out beautifully with minimal maintenance.</p>

    <p>Whether you want subtle, face-framing warmth or a dramatic blonde transformation, balayage can be customized to suit your hair type, skin tone, and lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect During Your Balayage Appointment</h2>
    <p>Every balayage appointment at Glow Salon & Spa begins with a consultation. Your stylist will discuss your hair goals, examine your current color and condition, and create a customized plan. Here is what the process typically looks like:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Consultation (10-15 minutes):</strong> We discuss your inspiration photos, hair history, and desired outcome. This is the time to share any photos of looks you love.</li>
        <li><strong>Color application (60-90 minutes):</strong> Your stylist hand-paints the lightener onto your hair, focusing on areas where the sun would naturally lighten. This freehand technique is what gives balayage its signature natural look.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing time (30-45 minutes):</strong> The lightener develops while you relax. Your stylist checks the progress regularly to achieve the perfect lift.</li>
        <li><strong>Toning and styling (30 minutes):</strong> A toner is applied to achieve the perfect shade, whether that is a warm caramel, an ashy blonde, or a rich honey. Then we finish with a blow-dry and style.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In total, expect your balayage appointment to take about 2.5 to 3.5 hours, depending on your hair length and the level of transformation.</p>

    <h2>Balayage Maintenance Tips</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest advantages of balayage is that it requires less maintenance than traditional highlights. Here are our top tips for keeping your color looking fresh:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use color-safe shampoo:</strong> Sulfate-free shampoos help preserve your color and prevent premature fading.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit heat styling:</strong> When you do use heat tools, always apply a heat protectant spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule a color glaze:</strong> A glaze ($70 with blow-dry at Glow Salon) refreshes your tone between appointments and adds shine.</li>
        <li><strong>Book touch-ups every 12-16 weeks:</strong> Because balayage grows out naturally, you can go longer between appointments than with traditional foil highlights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Balayage Right for You?</h2>
    <p>Balayage works beautifully on almost every hair type and length. It is especially great if you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Want a low-maintenance color that grows out gracefully</li>
        <li>Prefer a natural, dimensional look over uniform highlights</li>
        <li>Are coloring your hair for the first time and want something subtle</li>
        <li>Have dark hair and want to add warmth without a dramatic change</li>
    </ul>
